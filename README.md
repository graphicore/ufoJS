ufoJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphicore/ufoJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphicore/ufoJS)
=====

With ufoJS you can load, manipulate and save font data in JavaScript.
A [UFO: Unified Font Object](http://unifiedfontobject.org) is a directory 
based file format representing font data in a human readable way. UFO
is already supported by all major font development tools. ufoJS enables
browser based font development tools that blend nicely into
professional workflows.

ufoJS is tested with nodeJS and current Firefox and Chrome. You can run the
unit tests with other browsers and see where it breaks and where it works.

### Current State:
The GlyphSet and its dependencies are implemented and tested. This means
you now have control over everything in the `glyphs` directory of your
UFOv2/v3 and the UFOv3 layers (which is data wise the same as the
`glyphs` directory). However, this is not stable yet. We will definitely
find some bugs when using it.

Not in the box yet are the APIs for everything above the glyph layer level.
This is the next big task.


### Actions:
 * Run the [Testsuite](http://lib.ufojs.org/env/tests.html)
 * Sample application: [Glif Renderer](http://lib.ufojs.org/env/glif-renderer.xhtml)

Technology remarks
------------------

The starting point for ufoJS is porting RoboFab to JavaScript. Once this
is done to a satisfactory point, we can start with optimizing the APIs and
inner  workings for new challenges. However, the first goal is to become
useful and fully unit tested.

There are already significant differences to the RoboFab legacy:

 * ufoJS provides both a synchronous and an [asynchronous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O)
   API.
   
   * The asynchronous API is particularly useful for User Interfaces or
   fast NodeJS based servers. JavaScript developers know this concept already.
   * The synchronous API is useful for adhoc-scripting, simple command line
     programms or webworkers. It is less complex to write synchronous scripts.
     
   [ObtainJS](https://github.com/graphicore/obtainJS) is used to implement the
   asynchronous and synchronous API side by side. Go to the OtainJS
   Repository to learn how to use APIs implemented with it or how to implement
   APIs with ObtainJS.
   
 * ufoJS does file system abstraction based on a dependency injection
   pattern. You can write your own persistence module and just use it.
   See the [I/O modules](https://github.com/graphicore/ufoJS/tree/master/lib/tools/io)
   for the yet early state of the Interface.

There is no good Documentation or guide yet. You are welcome to start that
and I would gladly support you. In the meantime your options are:

* [Read the source, Luke](http://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/)
  and read the unit tests, too. Also, there is a mini sample App, the [glif-renderer](./env/glif-renderer.xhtml)
* See how things are done with RoboFab and try to transfer you knowledge.

### Code Input

ufoJS is based on porting the Python code of FontTools and RoboFab to JavaScript.

The files of the Python sources are referenced in the headers of the files
of this project.

### Dependencies

The Project itself uses an [Modules/AsynchronousDefinition-Loader](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition)
defined by [commonJs](http://www.commonjs.org/) and currently provided by
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [RequireJS for nodeJs](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js)
Author: James Burke

The Tests are driven by (an old version of) the [D.O.H: Dojo Objective Harness](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/doh.html)
Authors: Alex Russell, Pete Higgins, Dustin Machi, Jared Jurkiewicz

The implementation of the Synchronous/Asynchronous APIs is made
with [ObtainJS](https://github.com/graphicore/obtainJS) Author: Lasse Fister
